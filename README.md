# Stress Prediction from Video Frames using Deep Learning

This project detects stress levels from video frame sequences using deep learning techniques (CNN + LSTM). It uses pose detection, clustering of body keypoints, and model training.

## Features

- MediaPipe for pose extraction
- K-Means for clustering postures
- CNN + LSTM model for stress prediction
- Confusion matrix and accuracy evaluation

## Technologies

- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run

1. Upload dataset to Google Drive
2. Run the notebook in Google Colab
3. Install libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
